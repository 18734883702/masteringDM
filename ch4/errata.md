Errors in this chapter:

(1) Figure 4 has an error. The correct diagram would show one node of degree 1, one node of degree 2, and three nodes of degree 3. The chart and text incorrectly state that two nodes have a degree of 2 and two nodes have a degree of 3. 

(2) The .csv files are not actually comma-separated values, rather they are tab-separated, so should properly be called .tsv files.
